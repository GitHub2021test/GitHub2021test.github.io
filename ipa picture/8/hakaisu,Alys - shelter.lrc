[00:48.460]I could never find the right way to tell you
[00:53.830]Have you noticed I've been gone
[00:59.620]Cause I left behind the home that you made me
[01:05.690]But I will carry it along
[01:09.860]
[01:10.740]It's a long way forward
[01:13.420]Trust in me
[01:16.310]I'll give them shelter like you've done for me
[01:21.800]And I know, I'm not alone
[01:26.180]You'll be watching over us
[01:28.990]Until you're gone
[01:32.710]
[01:35.070]
